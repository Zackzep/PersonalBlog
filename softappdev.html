            <p>An area I'm considering focusing on with regards to a career path is software application development.  While my understanding of it at the current time is very broad, it touches on aspects of my life that I'm not only interested in, but grateful for.  If you've ever had the experience of manually randomizing a board game setup versus having an app that does it for you in seconds, you know exactly what I mean.  Plant watering schedules, DnD charachter progression automation, hiking trails, or anything else that can not only give you information, but help you be more efficient are things we're all very happy to have at our disposal.  As someone who obsesses over planning, organization, efficiency, and min-maxing, I could certainly see myself getting into a field like this purely out of interest.</p>

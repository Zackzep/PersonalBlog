            <p>With the original released in 2004, the series has seen massive success in Japan and worldwide major success with the release of Monster Hunter: World in 2018, becoming Capcom's largest selling game of all time.  Logging over 1000 hours in several releases, I can confidently claim this is my favorite series of all time.  In a world where major releases are often littered with bugs and constant fixes upon release, the consistent clean output from the series is a reminder of how polished of a product Capcom consistently puts out.</p>
            <p>Monster Hunter: World ran on Capcom's internal engine MT Framework 2.x, which ephasized player interaction with flora among other benefits.  This allowed the world of Monster Hunter to really come to life, such as exploring lush jungles and forests, swamps, etc.  Future releases seem to be slated to run on the RE engine as it seems to be successor to MT Framework.  The appeal here, for me, is how efficiently Capmcom seems to design their games through these engines.  Few games rivaled the scale and graphics of Monster Hunter in the days of their handheld releases.</p>

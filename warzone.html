   <p>Originally released in 1999 on PC, I have a soft spot for this RTS game Warzone 2100 as it was the first video game I've ever played.  Over twenty years later I still find myself playing it every few years for one major reason, I have yet to see a game combine unit customization and base building in a way as enjoyable as this.  While some aspects are certainly dated at this point, namely pace and depth of strategy, I still find it unrivaled in other areas.  Impressive for a game that did not achieve much in the way of success.</p>
   <p>Where this gets interesting is that after Pumkin Studios closed with the creation of only this game, Warzone 2100 was released to an open source format allowing anyone to tinker away at is as they pleased.  What followed was twenty years of regular updates, additions, and fixes, with a community that is still going to this day.  With many aspects overhauled, much of it is unrecognizable next to the original.  I could certainly see myself working with this as a sort of pet project to keep me busy.</p>

    <p>kjhgfdsdfghMy interest in the coding aspect of technology began with the realization there were
        similarities between the structure in code and symbolic logic.  As a graduate in philosophy, 
        that thoroughly enjoyed logic based courses, this intruiged me.  Coupled with the desire to 
        have the freedom to work remotely I felt studying code was an opportunity I had to jump on.</p>
    <p>As far as what direction I plan to take this professionally, I don't quite have an idea as this 
        is all very fresh to me.  However I can narrow down possibilities based on interests I have.  
        Regarding things more blatantly connected to tech, I enjoy video games and software implementations 
        of board games.  Ending up in that field, writing code to bring these things to life, would in my 
        opinion be the pinnacle of where I could potentially end up.  Furthermore as a regular hiker, kayaker, 
        and soon to be skiier, something related to the outdoors could be interesting as well.  However I can't 
        envision much beyond apps and electronic gear where coding specifically could lead me in this direction.
        Additionally, though not a vested interest of mine, I could see web page development potentially not 
        only being an avenue, but fascinating.</p>

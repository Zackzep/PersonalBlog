    <p>Prior to my first course focusing on web development, I did not have it on my radar whatsoever.  While it may not be the only direction regarding code that has an artistic element to it, it certainly feels like one of the more prominant ones.  As someone who either never really practiced art or has the brain for it, seeing how art and code can come together in a harmonious way allowing for someone like myself to be involved was very intruiging.  I can't say I currently know where my interests lie in this department, but it's an entirely new avenue I'm now considering.</p>
